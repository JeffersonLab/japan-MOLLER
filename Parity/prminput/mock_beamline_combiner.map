# Rules for this file
# - no repeating dependent variables in the same section
#   (probably also not in different sections, come to think of it)
#
# - Alias names start with "@" after the "asym" or "diff" prefix.
#   Only use the "diff" if you really just want the difference; BCMs
#   or detector signals should probably use "asym".
#
# - The device names should use the same case as the branch in the
#   evt TTree, i.e. usually would be lower case, but BPM coordinate
#   labels (for instance) are upper case:
#      use "bpm1h04X" not "bpm1h04x"
#
# - The weights are applied directly; if you want to average two
#   quantities, the weights should be 0.5 on both.
#
